1. How would you categorize your current fitness level?
Intermediate

2. How often do you workout? 
Walk daily, exercise bike few times a week, strength training when my neck/back are not an issue.

3. What do you do for cardio?
Run, walk, elliptical and bike.

4. Are you doing any resistance training (lifting weights)?
Yes

5. Do you belong to a gym or fitness facility? If so, do you generally take group fitness classes, workout on your own, or both?
Home gym

6. Do you have any health problems? If so, please list them and any medications you are taking.
Yes, slipped and bulging discs from a car accident.  My neck is my biggest issue, it has pain most days.  I also have migraines so I’ve had to cut back my distance running.

7. Do you have any injuries that may restrict you from particular exercises?
Anything that may make my neck worse.  I currently avoid sit-ups and any strength training that strains my neck.

8. What is your favorite type of exercise? Running, cycling, lifting weights, group fitness classes, cross fit, martial arts, etc.
I used to love running.

9. Do you feel you eat a fairly healthy diet?
I’ve been vegetarian my whole life and lean closer to a vegan diet, so yep ;)

10. What goals do you want to meet by working with a trainer?
I’ve put on 10 pounds this year because I stopped distance running and have been limited on my workouts.  I need help working out safely where I can feel confident I’m staying healthy but that I won’t reinjure my neck.  My weight isn’t a huge concern for me but staying active is!

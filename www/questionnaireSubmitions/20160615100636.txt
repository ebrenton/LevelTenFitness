no

8. What is your favorite type of exercise? Running, cycling, lifting weights, group fitness classes, cross fit, martial arts, etc.
elliptical and lifting weights.  i hate running.  

9. Do you feel you eat a fairly healthy diet?
it's not horrible but i know it could be better

10. What goals do you want to meet by working with a trainer?
I want to get back in shape.  Increase my muscle mass and decrease my body fat.  Lose inches.  Finding time to do this is the worst part.  I work full time and have a 2 year old at home.  I already wake up at 5AM just to be at work for 630 so working out in the morning before work has been impossible and once he's asleep, the last thing I want to do is drive to the gym.  I am considering in-home personal training.
